## Routine Maintenance

1. Start from a clean working tree and review dependency release notes before major upgrades.
2. Install dependencies from the committed lockfile where available.
3. Run the project's available checks before merging:

```text
Review the project-specific detailed documentation below
```

4. Confirm that no local agent state, generated output, credentials, or machine-specific files are tracked.
5. Smoke-test every platform affected by the change.
6. Update README.md when commands, platform support, or product behavior changes.

## Security

- Keep secrets in ignored local environment files and production secret managers.
- Never use browser-exposed environment prefixes for private credentials.
- Rotate a credential immediately if it reaches source control, logs, screenshots, or generated agent artifacts.
- Review production dependency advisories before a release; test major upgrades separately.

- [ ] Working tree reviewed
- [ ] Dependency lockfiles intentional
